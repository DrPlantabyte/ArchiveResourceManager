# ArchiveResourceManager
A small java library for storing data in a zip files under the following assumptions:
- you want to use a single archive to transfer data that would normally exist in multiple files
- the amount of data exceeds the amount of RAM available on your computer
- you may want to manually edit your data using only common software that is freely available for all desktop computers.
